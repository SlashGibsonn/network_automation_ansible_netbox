#
# Ansible 2.9.6 (and older) still allows special characters in group names, but with a deprecation warning.
# Special characters will not be allowed in Ansible 2.10 and later.
# Consider renaming the group to remove the dash, and edit the playbook accordingly
#
# Use this inventory file with the getver1, getver2, and getrun playbooks 
#
# Edit the following variables in the group vars section, based on the user/pass and enable secret you configured on your switches:
# ansible_user=myuser   (user on the switch)
# ansible_password=userpass  (above user's password)
# ansible_become_password=enablepass  (the enable secret to get into privileged mode)

#
# Ansible 2.9.6 (and older) still allows special characters in group names, but with a deprecation warning.
# Special characters will not be allowed in Ansible 2.10 and later.
# Consider renaming the group to remove the dash, and edit the playbook accordingly
#
# Use this with the ad-hoc commands, and the getarp1 and getmacaddress1 playbooks, as they use raw commands.
# Including variables in here will prevent ad-hoc and those two playbooks from working
